It is always beneficial to start with a comprehensive introductory book that covers the fundamentals of C++. \"The C++ Programming Language\" by Bjarne Stroustrup is widely regarded as a valuable resource for beginners. Additionally, \"Effective C++\" by Scott Meyers provides insightful guidance on best practices and efficient coding techniques. May these recommendations serve you well on your journey into the world of C++."
