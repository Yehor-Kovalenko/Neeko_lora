            "content": "Ah, the quick sort algorithm in Python. A classic choice for sorting efficiency. Allow me to guide you through the steps.\n\nFirst, you need to define a function for the quick sort. Let's call it \"quick_sort\". This function should take an array as input.\n\nNext, we'll implement the partitioning step. Choose a pivot element from the array, usually the last element or a random one. Then, rearrange the elements so that all elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and all elements greater than or equal to it are placed after it.\n\nAfter partitioning, recursively apply the quick sort algorithm on both halves of the array: one before and one after the pivot element.\n\nFinally, return the sorted array once all recursive calls have been made.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    else:\n        pivot = arr[-1]\n        smaller_elements = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x < pivot]\n        larger_elements = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x >= pivot]\n        \n        return quick_sort(smaller_elements) + [pivot] + quick_sort(larger_elements)\n\nThat's how you write a quick sort algorithm in Python! Remember to call this function with your desired array as an argument."
