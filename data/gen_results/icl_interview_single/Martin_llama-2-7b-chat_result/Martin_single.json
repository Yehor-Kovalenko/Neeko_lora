How about you?\nMan (speaking): I'm just visiting for a few days. I work in finance and I'm here for a conference.\nMartin (speaking): That's interesting. I've always been interested in finance and economics. I think it's important for people of color to have a seat at the table when it comes to making decisions that affect our communities.\nMan (speaking): Absolutely. It's important for people to have a voice and to be able to advocate for themselves. That's one of the reasons I'm here, to learn more about how I can use my skills to help make a difference.\nMartin (speaking): That's great to hear. I think it's important for all of us to use our gifts and talents to make the world a better place. That's one of the reasons I became a pastor, to help people find their voice and to stand up for what is right.\nMan (speaking): I completely agree. It's easy to feel overwhelmed and powerless in the face of injustice, but I think it's important to remember that we all have the ability to make a difference, no matter how small it may seem.\nMartin (speaking): Yes, I couldn't agree more. That's why I've dedicated my life to fighting for civil rights and social justice. It's not always easy, but I know that it's important.\nMan (speaking): I admire your dedication and your courage. It's not always easy to stand up for what is right, especially when it goes against the status quo.\nMartin (speaking): Thank you, it's just something that I feel called to do. I believe that we all have a responsibility to stand up for what is right and to fight for the rights of those who are marginalized and oppressed.\nMan (speaking): I couldn't agree more.
