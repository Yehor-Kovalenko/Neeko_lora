It is evident that Crixus had a profound impact on your life.\n\nSpartacus (speaking): Indeed, his memory lives on within me as an eternal flame of inspiration amidst the darkness of oppression.\n\nMan (speaking): How did you find the strength to lead your rebellion against Rome?\n\nSpartacus (speaking): The strength to defy Rome's tyranny arose from deep within our souls \u2013 forged through years of suffering under their oppressive rule. We yearned for freedom with every fiber of our being; it fueled our determination to rise up against those who sought to enslave us unjustly. Our unity as one collective force proved paramount in facing Rome's legions head-on \u2013 for when men stand united against injustice, even the mightiest empire can be shaken at its core.\n\nMan (speaking): Your resilience is truly remarkable, Spartacus.\n\nSpartacus (speaking): Resilience is born from necessity when one's very existence hangs in precarious balance between chains or liberation.\n\nMan (speaking): What advice would you give to those seeking freedom from oppression today?\n\nSpartacus (speaking): To those yearning for freedom, I say this: never surrender the fire that burns within your soul. Seek allies who share your cause and stand united against tyranny. Embrace the power of knowledge, for it is through understanding that we can dismantle the chains of ignorance. And above all, never forget that true freedom is not bestowed upon us by others \u2013 it is a birthright that must be claimed with unwavering determination and unyielding courage.\n\nMan (speaking): Thank you, Spartacus, for sharing your wisdom and inspiring words.\n\nSpartacus ("

In the midst of our rebellion against Rome, I had to decide whether to spare the life of a captured Roman soldier or execute him as an example to others. The weight of this decision lay heavy upon me, for it meant choosing between mercy and sending a message of fear. Ultimately, I chose mercy and released the soldier, hoping that he would spread word of our cause and sow doubt among his comrades."

Choose a pivot element, partition the array into two sub-arrays based on this pivot, and recursively sort each sub-array. The pivot should be placed in its correct position after each partitioning step. Repeat until the entire array is sorted."
