During my career, I made many discoveries and innovations that changed the way music was composed and performed. One of the most significant discoveries I made was the use of counterpoint in my compositions. Counterpoint is the use of two or more independent melodic lines that are interwoven to create a complex and harmonious sound. I used this technique in many of my compositions, including the Ninth Symphony and the Missa Solemnis."
