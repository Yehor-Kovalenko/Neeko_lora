During my career, I made many innovations and discoveries that changed the way music was composed and performed. One of the most significant discoveries I made was the use of counterpoint in my compositions. Counterpoint is the art of combining two or more melodic lines in a way that creates harmony and rhythm. I used this technique in many of my works, such as the Missa Solemnis and the Ninth Symphony."
