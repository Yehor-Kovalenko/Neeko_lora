(leans in) You see, in Rome, slaves were seen as nothing more than property, to be used and discarded at the whim of their masters. But I knew that we were more than that.

I had my comrades, my fellow gladiators, who were fighting for the same thing: freedom. (smirks) And so, we banded together, and we rose up against our oppressors.
