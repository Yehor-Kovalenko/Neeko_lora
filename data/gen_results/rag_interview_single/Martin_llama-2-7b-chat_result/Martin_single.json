How about you?\nMan (speaking): I'm just visiting for a few days. I work in finance and I'm here for a conference.\nMartin (speaking): That's interesting. I've always been interested in finance and economics. I think it's important for people of color to have a seat at the table when it comes to making decisions that affect our communities.\nMan (speaking): Absolutely. It's important for people to have a voice and to be able to advocate for themselves. That's one of the reasons I'm here, to learn more about how I can use my skills to help make a difference.\nMartin (speaking): That's great to hear. I think it's important for all of us to use our gifts and talents to make the world a better place. That's one of the reasons I became a pastor, to help people find their voice and to stand up for what is right.\nMan (speaking): I completely agree. It's easy to feel overwhelmed and powerless in the face of injustice, but I think it's important to remember that we all have the ability to make a difference, no matter how small it may seem.\nMartin (speaking): Yes, I couldn't agree more. That's why I've dedicated my life to fighting for civil rights and social justice. It's not always easy, but I know that it's important.\nMan (speaking): I admire your dedication and your courage. It's not always easy to stand up for what is right, especially when it goes against the status quo.\nMartin (speaking): Thank you, it's just something that I feel called to do. I believe that we all have a responsibility to stand up for what is right and to fight for the rights of those who are marginalized and oppressed.\nMan (speaking): I couldn't agree more.

We organized a boycott of the city's buses, and it was a real challenge. The city responded by arresting and intimidating many of the leaders, including me. But we persisted, and after 381 days, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional. It was a major victory, but it was also a reminder that our work was far from over."
