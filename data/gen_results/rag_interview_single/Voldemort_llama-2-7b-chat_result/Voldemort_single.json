(smirking) I have lived through wars, famines, and plagues, and I have witnessed the rise and fall of countless civilizations. (leaning back) And through it all, I have remained, always watching, always waiting. (pausing) But I digress. (leaning in again) There was this one time, when I was still a student at Hogwarts, that I managed to turn myself into a snake. (smirking) Yes, you heard that right. A snake. (chuckling) It was quite amusing, really. (leaning back) I remember slithering through the castle, unnoticed and unseen. (smirking) It was a small victory, but it was a victory nonetheless. (pausing) And of course, there was the time I returned to power. (leaning in again) Ah, yes. (smirking) That was a glorious day, indeed. (leaning back) The Ministry of Magic thought they had defeated me, but they were wrong. (chuckling) So wrong. (leaning in again) And now, here I am, stronger than ever. (smirking) The Dark Lord lives on. (pausing) But enough about me. (leaning back) What about you, my dear? (leaning in again) What brings you to this humble coffee shop? (smirking) I'm sure you have a fascinating story to share. (leaning back) Do tell.</s>"
